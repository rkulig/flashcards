# REST API Plan

## 1. Resources

- **User / Auth**: Supabase Auth for user registration, login, JWT issuance, and session management.
- **Flashcards**: Individual flashcards created manually or accepted from AI proposals; maps to table `flashcards`.
- **Generations**: AI generation sessions storing metadata; maps to table `generations`.
- **GenerationErrorLogs**: Records errors during AI generation; maps to table `generation_error_logs`.

  - 401 Unauthorized
  - 500 Internal Server Error (AI failure)

#### GET /api/generations

  ```


## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Use Supabase Auth JWTs passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- Enforce row-level security on tables (`flashcards`, `generations`, `generation_error_logs`) so users can access only their own records.
- Validate JWT claim `sub` as the user's UUID for all write and read operations.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic

- Input validation:
  - `text` length: 1000â€“10000 characters (as per generation schema).
  - `front`: non-empty, max 200 chars.
  - `back`: non-empty, max 500 chars.
  - `source` enum: one of [`ai-full`,`ai-edited`,`manual`].
- Business rules:
  - On generation success, increment `generations.generated_count` and store session metadata.
  - On batch accept, insert records into `flashcards` with correct `generation_id`, update `accepted_unedited_count`/`accepted_edited_count`.
  - On AI errors, insert into `generation_error_logs`.
